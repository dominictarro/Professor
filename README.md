## About
The professor is a dual project: both a library and a bot. Its
mission is to offer a structured process of administering and
building quizzes in **Discord**.

### Library
The library allows other discord.py developers to build quizzing
bots using **Professor**'s `build.objects`. For those interested
in further customization, abstract classes and methods are
available to develop unique questions and quizzes that integrate
with the existing administration system.

### Bot
The bot offers Discord servers a quiz development and
administration platform. Server roles can be given permissions
to host and create/edit the server's quizzes. Users who have
participated in a server's quizzes can view their performance
history and statistics and even share it with their peers!

Quiz editors can receive thorough metrics about their quizzes
and questions to improve their users' experience.
