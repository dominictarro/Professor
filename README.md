## About
The professor is a dual project: both a library and a bot. Its
mission is to offer a structured process of administering and
building quizzes in **Discord**.

### [Library](https://github.com/dominictarro/ProfessorLib)
The library allows other discord.py developers to build quiz
and question objects using **Professor**'s `discord` library.
For those interested in further customization, base classes
and methods are found in `core` to develop unique quiz and 
question classes that can integrate with the existing library.

### Bot
The bot offers Discord servers a quiz development and
administration platform. Server roles can be given permissions
to host and create/edit the server's quizzes. Users who have
participated in a server's quizzes can view their performance
history and statistics and even share it with their peers!

Quiz editors can receive thorough metrics about their quizzes
and questions to improve their users' experience.
